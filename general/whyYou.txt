why should we hire you?

you should hire me because im cool asf man

...because although i dont have a degree, that didnt stop me from learning how to code and i kept at it instead of giving up.
i have created x amount of projects ....
i have got other people into software development as well,
i have made my own circle where we learn how to code together,
