what are some mistakes?
  i let a manager sweet talk me with a high position but in the end
   they hung it infront of me and made me over work myself based on a false promiose
how did you handle it?
  i confronted them about i dont like how im being payed as a cashire but i work as a supervisor
  inevitablty i moved to stock for less hours so i could focus more on studying this carrer
