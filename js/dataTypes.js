//some of them are primitives :
//Boolean - true false
//numbers (whole numbers, floating point numbers)
//null - empty value that a user has assigned
//undefined - no vale
//strings - 'hello'

//non-primitives
//objects
//arrays
//maps - contains datas in key-value pair
//sets - unordered and contains different elements
