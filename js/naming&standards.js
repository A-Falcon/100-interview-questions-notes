//coding ettiquite
//naming conventions


//booleans: try to use the IS HAS prefix because it reads cleaner

//function calls that return something: prefix the name with a verb
//avoid 'hungarian notation' (outdated practice) which is putting bool or num in their variables
// now wwe have typescript so its no necessary

//css coding principles
// have few as few selectors as possible so that css cascades nicly


//do not have variable names in all caps

// have less variables as possible to avoid clutter

//avoid 'magic numbers' (numbers came out of no where)
//macke sure to declare your magic nubmers
