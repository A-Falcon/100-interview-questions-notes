/* whata re your best practics in css?
mention things like: 

  - Block Element Modifier as a naming convention for organizing css
  - create a global stylehseet thats loosly based off the elements on the page
  - keep your selectors grouped to a certain degree (mapping out how it will all fall together)
  - the lessthe css the better (its less messy)
