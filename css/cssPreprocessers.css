/* css preprocessers provide the same functionality as css but slightly different syntax 

some of them are: 
  - SASS
    - nesting of css
    - adding variablies in our css
    - mixins
      - usually used when you have a large snippet of css properties (for things that are very detailed)
    - used to handle outdated browsers so that they are all happy


might make build time a little longer
