/* css specificty || cascading || inheritance */

/* css spec. is about what styles override what styles based on our selectors */

/* less specific to most: 
  * is the most loose selector because it selects everything.

  having an h1 as a selector will select all the h1's

  adding a . to our selector(having a class) will override the base selector 

  adding a # to our selector (an ID) will override the class 

  chaining them together will have higher order over those

  then there are inline styles in the html

  and last there is the !important on our css declaration (usally a bad convention)
